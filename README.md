# Election Analysis
Analyze election results using Python
##Overview of Election-Audit
After developing the code to analyze election results for a group of candidates, I expanded upon its functionality to analyze results by county. For candidates, this detailed analysis tallied the total number of votes in the given election, the total number of votes each candidate recieved alongside the percentage of votes they recieved, and displayed which among the candidates had won along with their statistics. For counties, this analysis tallied the total number of votes submitted by each county and their percentage of the total vote. After the statistics for each county had been tallied, the county with the largest voter turnout is displayed. Finally, all of the analyses were compiled into a text file for easy transmission and readability.
